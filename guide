Ruby On Rails Challenge


Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a URL shortener API. Feel free to use any of the tools you are most familiar with (i.e Rails, Resque, Sidekiq, Rspec, Rubocop).


CORE REQUIREMENTS



• We must be able to put a URL into the home page and get back a URL of

the shortest possible length.

• We must be redirected to the full URL when we enter the short URL (ex:

http://localhost:3000/a => https://google.com)


• There should be a page that shows the top 100 most frequently

accessed URLs.


• There must be a background job that crawls the URL being shortened, pulls the <title> from the website and stores it.


• Display the title with the URL on the top 100 board.


• There must be a README that explains how to setup the application and

the algorithm used for generating the URL short code.


NICE TO HAVE: 


Write a bot to populate your DB, and include it in the source code

Write Unit or Integration Tests


DELIVERABLES


Github repository that should be sent at the END of the pair programming exercise.


NOTES / HINTS


• Be verbose with your commit messages as this will allow us to understand

some of the decisions you make throughout the process.




• Feel free to use different parameter names, input types, and URLs. Remember to apply validations and think about edge cases.


• Research and understand how to code an efficient URL shortener. Random strings with a fx length of chars is not an efficient answer. There is a Stack Overflow answer with the algorithm. Part of the skills evaluated are to search the internet efficiently and add being able to distinguish safe and efficient solutions.



• You can use whatever database you are comfortable with. For the for the purposes of this exercise, we recommend a relational database.


• Don't forget things like validations and demonstrating good clean Object Oriented Programming.
